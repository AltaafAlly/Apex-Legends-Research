For console data set, the random forest imputation worked the best since we observed a higher correlation between the features. 

On the other hand, for the PC data set, the mice imputation worked the best.

Try Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) for clustering.
