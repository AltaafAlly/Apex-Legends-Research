For your research investigation, we can structure your paper into key sections that reflect the typical flow of an empirical study. Here's a breakdown of the sections you might consider using, tailored to the type of analysis you're conducting for *Apex Legends* player performance:

### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Purpose**: Introduce the game (*Apex Legends*) and set the stage for why player performance analysis is important. Explain what you aim to investigate, such as platform-specific performance and the impact of legend selection.
   - **Key elements**:
     - Brief overview of *Apex Legends* as a competitive game.
     - Research questions (e.g., how platform and legend choice influence player performance).
     - Hypotheses (e.g., PC players outperform console players due to hardware advantages).

### 2. **Literature Review**
   - **Purpose**: Present relevant research on game performance, platform differences, and aggressiveness metrics. This will ground your study in existing work.
   - **Key elements**:
     - Overview of existing studies on FPS games and player performance.
     - References to studies on cross-platform performance differences.
     - Discussion of how player metrics like kills, damage, and wins have been used to measure success or aggressiveness in similar games.
   - **Subsections**:
     - **Performance Metrics** (kills, damage, wins, etc.)
     - **Platform-Specific Performance** (differences in hardware, matchmaking, aim assist)
     - **Playstyle Aggressiveness** (methods of measuring aggressiveness)

### 3. **Methodology**
   - **Purpose**: Explain how you collected the data and which metrics you'll be analyzing. Include the reasoning behind the third-party API, how you processed the data, and why you chose to focus on leaderboards.
   - **Key elements**:
     - Data collection method (third-party API, public leaderboards).
     - Description of datasets (Career Stats and Legend Stats).
     - The formula for calculating the Playstyle Aggressiveness Score (PAS).
   - **Subsections**:
     - **Data Collection**: Details of the leaderboard data, number of players, platforms, etc.
     - **Variables/Features**: List of player performance metrics (BR kills, damage, wins).
     - **Playstyle Aggressiveness Score**: Description and justification of your formula.

### 4. **Data Analysis and Results**
   - **Purpose**: Present your statistical analysis and findings.
   - **Key elements**:
     - Analysis of how players on different platforms perform (PC vs. PlayStation vs. Xbox).
     - Legend-specific analysis (which Legends have higher kills, damage, and wins).
     - Evaluation of the PAS and its relationship with performance metrics like win rate.
   - **Subsections**:
     - **Platform-Specific Performance Analysis**: Compare metrics like kills, damage, and wins across platforms.
     - **Legend-Specific Analysis**: Examine how different legends influence player performance.
     - **Playstyle Aggressiveness Analysis**: Investigate whether PAS correlates with success (wins).

### 5. **Discussion**
   - **Purpose**: Interpret your findings in light of your hypotheses and previous research.
   - **Key elements**:
     - Why do certain platforms (e.g., PC) outperform others?
     - Why might specific legends have better performance stats?
     - How useful is the PAS metric in evaluating aggressiveness and success?
     - Compare your findings with existing literature (are your results consistent with other studies?).
   - **Subsections**:
     - **Platform Differences**: Why do we observe performance differences between platforms?
     - **Legend Impact**: Why do certain legends perform better?
     - **Evaluation of PAS**: Does the PAS formula accurately measure aggressiveness?

### 6. **Conclusion**
   - **Purpose**: Summarize your main findings and the implications for players and developers.
   - **Key elements**:
     - Restate your research questions and whether your hypotheses were supported.
     - Highlight the most important findings from the platform and legend-specific analyses.
     - Discuss potential applications of the PAS in esports or player training.
     - Mention any limitations (e.g., reliance on leaderboard data) and future research directions.

### 7. **References**
   - **Purpose**: List all the academic papers, articles, and studies you referenced in your research.
   - **Key elements**:
     - Include all the references from the literature review and throughout your paper.

### 8. **Appendix (if necessary)**
   - **Purpose**: Include additional tables, graphs, or code snippets that were too detailed for the main text.
   - **Key elements**:
     - Data processing steps or specific code used for the analysis.
     - Extra figures or tables that were not central to your main findings but provide additional context.

### Suggested Order of Work:
1. **Methodology**: Start by finalizing your data collection process and variables used. This will include documenting how the data was gathered (public leaderboards, third-party API) and clearly defining the metrics you plan to analyze.
   
2. **Data Analysis and Results**: Once the methodology is set, dive into analyzing your datasets. You already have visualizations, so expand on those results by comparing platforms and legends.

3. **Literature Review**: While doing the analysis, start building the literature review to back up your metrics and approach. This will help you justify your analysis and provide theoretical grounding for your PAS formula.

4. **Discussion**: After completing your analysis, interpret your findings and relate them back to the literature. Identify any interesting trends or platform-specific behaviors and compare your PAS results to existing theories.

5. **Introduction and Conclusion**: Write these last, as they are summaries of the entire research. The introduction sets up what youâ€™re investigating, while the conclusion summarizes your findings and future directions.
